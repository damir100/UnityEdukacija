using the five elements of user

experience in game design this is based

upon the book the elements of user

experience by Jesse James Garrett so

there are five planes or five elements

to user experience that surfaced

skeleton structure scope and strategy so

we're going to go through each of these

and then we're to look at how it applies

to game design so surface is the images

and text so these are some elements or

superficial and games and others are

interactive so you may have a door that

you can go through and you may have a

door you can't go through and that's

really kind of the surface is what that

looks like the images that exist there

and so if you're looking at something

like BioShock Infinite there may be

doors that you can't go through you

can't really interact with this thing

over here but you may then be able to

pick up these guns over here those are

the images that we see it's very visual

very concrete the skeleton is the next

element that's the placement of the

buttons controls and images so if the

wireframe of the design and it includes

the interface design and the navigation

design 

so the skeleton what it does is

it optimizes arrangement for max effect 

and efficiency it's also dictating what

 visual elements are on the screen and 

dictates how those interactions are

presented and arranged it also suggests

 a way to move around the space and how

that content is presented so if you look

at the skeleton here it's really that

wireframe and this automatically then

assumes the way that you're going to go

through so if you are going through this

image it guides you through here guides

you through here you may stop off at

that door but that's the idea of the

wireframe and so it's that skeleton now

based upon that navigation we know we're

gonna put these types of images here we

know we're gonna put this kind of ID

over here that's how that skeleton

it dictates the surface the next one is

structure and structure is the placement

of the interface eight elements and that

includes the interaction design and the

information architecture so interaction

design is how the user interacts and how

that product behaves in response so if I

push a button how does it behave if I

push this how does it behave if I go

over here and move into this how does it

behave information architecture is the

arrangement of content elements and how

they are organized to facilitate human

understanding so how are those elements

put together and how do we understand

that so structure defines how the user

got to where they are it also defines

the navigational elements and it defines

what exists in the UI so the HUD or the

menu screens and it defines how

everything fits together now in

structure a lot of times that structure

is based upon the narrative so what is

the story that's happening in the game

so in BioShock Infinite you have a story

and that's the structure and it's

dictating how you move through

everything and that movement through

everything is what dictates that images

that go on top so if we look at this we

have an idea of structure it tells a

specific story it gives a specific

feeling and based upon the character

that we are it's going to make us feel a

specific way it's going to affect our

user experience if you look here we also

have the way that it navigates us

through so we know based upon the story

that we need to go into the city and so

we in BioShock Infinite you hit one of

your triggers and it automatically then

takes you into and shows you an arrow

with saying hey this is how you do it if

you also look up here you have the

interface so the user interfaces here

and that's part of the structures well

same thing here we have our user

interface and so you can see down here

the different

weapons that you have you have over here

your salts you have up here then your

life and the shield the scope is the

fourth element and that defines the

functional requirements and content

requirements so the functional

requirements is how features work with

each other and how they interrelate so

it's used to reach the final goal so

what's the function what are we trying

to get to in gaming the goal is the

functional requirement dictating how

items interrelate and setting up a

potential outcome so in BioShock

Infinite I have a specific goal I have a

specific story I'm trying to figure out

and that's the function and so my goal

is the function the content requirements

is the information we need to gather the

value so in many games the character is

content they provide the point of view

they provide the stories they also

provide the other elements to create the

narrative we can't have a narrative

without the character we can have a

character without narrative them so if

we look then at the characters that are

happening in BioShock Infinite we have

heads and tails we have Booker DeWitt

and Elizabeth we have the Prophet and

they all then carry specific values it

carries specific functions and carry

specific goals and finally the fifth

element is the strategy so the reason

for the product who is it for and who is

the user and why do people want it now

in gaming that is really the audience

and so the audience we have to go back

for strategy and ask why do we play

video games if you look at Parag comm it

has a video game user survey and they

found the top reasons why people play

games our immersion they're looking for

new worlds they're looking for diverse

gameplay and multiple mechanics they

want to relive history they want some

kind of freedom to do whatever they want

an environment and they'd like to

exploit and you know go through some big

thing and have this big thing happened

now looking at these five elements each

element lays on top of one another and

at the very top we have surface and at

the very bottom we have strategy as we

move from the bottom to the top we come

become more concrete as we move from the

top to the bottom we become more

abstract now each plane is then

dependent on the plane below it if you

don't have character you don't have a

narrative if you don't have a narrative

you don't have a skeleton if you don't

have a skeleton you don't have anything

to put in it also if they don't align it

won't equal the satisfaction so if the

structure and the character don't match

up you're not going to have satisfaction

so the five elements are highly

dependent on one another so how do we

apply this to games well games are

experiences and as we move from each

plane from the most abstract to the

concrete we have then at the very bottom

of that most abstract the user and why

we have the game then we have the seed

which is the central concept what is

what are we trying to say in this game

what is the point of this game and that

then dictates the genre the genre then

usually dictates the character and

reaches our expectations that character

then leads into story the story then

dictates the gameplay usually sometimes

it's the other way around that gameplay

then dictates the controls the controls

didn't lead to the user interface and

that leads to the look and style of the

game now if you want to look at this

further you can look at Garrett's book

the elements of user experience and you

can also look at the pewag data report

site to go further and that is using the

five elements of user experience and

game design
